## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your

## Write a short comment describing this function
## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the inverse of the matrix
## get the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getsolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)

}


## Write a short comment describing this function
##The second function cacheSolve, calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with 
# the above function. However, it first checks to see 
# if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets 
# the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
# Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and 
# sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the 
# setsolve function.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
  m <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(m)
  m
  
  
}
